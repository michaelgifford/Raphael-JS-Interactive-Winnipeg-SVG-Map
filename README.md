# Raphael-JS-Interactive-Winnipeg-SVG-Map

Interactive map I made of Winnipeg using the Raphael JavaScript framework. Map designed in Adobe Illustrator.



# Usage

1.) Download and unzip if necessary

2.) Load 'index.html' in a web browser

# Integrating into an existing project

CSS & Javascript
- Move the 'raphael-min.js' & 'winnipeg-map.js' files into your project's javascript folder

- Move the 'style.css' file into your project's css folder

- Reference these files in the HTML file where the map is being used. Adjust for your css/js folder names:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/style.css"/>
<script type="text/javascript" src="./js/raphael-min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="./js/winnipeg-map.js"></script>
```


HTML
- Insert a div with an id of 'winnipeg-map' and a class of 'winnipeg' where you'd like the map
- Insert a header (or span) tag with an id of 'neighbourhood-name' and a class of 'name-header' where you'd like the area label


Adjust styling to finalize integrating into your project
